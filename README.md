JSAnimation
===========

Experimenting with frame-based Javascript animations.
Eventually, I'd like this to become a plugin for the IPython notebook, so
that animations can be embedded automatically.  For a couple examples of
initial ideas along these lines, see
[this notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/5573741) and
[this blog post](http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2013/05/12/embedding-matplotlib-animations/).


Trying it Out
-------------
To test this out, first generate the frames by running

    python make_frames.py

then use your web browser to open the file ``animation.html``.
